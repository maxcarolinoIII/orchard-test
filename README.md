# Orchard FED Interface Test

This sample web application was made to fulfill the requirements for FED position at Orchard.

**Tech Stack**
- React JS - project was bootstrapped using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). I've chosen react mostly due to familiarity with it and the test requires challenging user experience like showing a modal which can be tricky to implement from scratch using vanilla JS.
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - design system for react, I've chose this since I'm already familiar with it and also to speed up the development process by using it's existing design components like buttons, text, etc. Responsive design can be done easily with it as well.
- Bundlers - bundlers are already configured by the create-react-app which uses webpack underneath.
